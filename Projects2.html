                <p>I like to learn through doing. My first stop on my reintroduction to programming was 'Human Resource Machine'
                    from the Tomorrow Corporation, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Outside this, I have been using Codecademy
                    and have so far completed their 'Learn HTML', 'Learn CSS', 'Introduction to JavaScript' and 'Make a Website'
                    courses. I am currently part-way through 'Learn Git'. To support my studying, I have also been reading
                    and practically working through 'A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript' by Mark Myers to further my knowledge
                    of key language and syntax, 'Eloquent JavaScript' by Marijn Haverbeke to develop my understanding of
                    concepts, and 'The Non-Designer's Design Book' by Robin Williams, to make sure everything is aesthetically
                    pleasing.

                    <p>This site has gone through a string of transformations since its inception! I started with just HTML
                        and CSS, but quickly got muddled up with class and id tags. It was back to square one, this time
                        using Bootstrap for it's grid. I am much happier with the result!</p>

                    <p>Recently I've started solving problems on Project Euler to get better at solving problems using the
                        knowledge of Javascript I already have. There aren't many solutions currently, but updating this
                        page everytime I do will be more than satisfying (even if they're not all solved in under a minute...)

                    <p>When I realised I would need to showcase my skills through a variety of projects, writing a Twitch
                        bot for my channel was my first idea. She's still in the first stages, and not as sophisticated as
                        I'd like her to be, but she's got a very bright future.
