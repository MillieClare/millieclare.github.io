                <h3>My goal is to be a better me today than the me from yesterday.</h3>
                <p>I started tinkering with webdesign over ten years ago, but it never crossed my mind that it could be my career
                    until I rediscovered coding in 2017. Since then, I have been working at building skills in HTML, CSS
                    & Javascript. The result so far is this website, built from scratch (with a little help from Bootstrap).
                    <br>
                    <br> For the past few years I have been a Music teacher working in both East and West London. I trained as
                    a Teach First LDP participant in 2013 (read: thrown into a classroom with 30 students after six weeks
                    of intense training!) and went on to become a Curriculum Leader in charge of a team of ten people. 
                    My teaching career had many wonderful moments, but the absolute highlight had to be leading a choir performance
                    in front of 600 past and present female MPs in Westminster Hall to celebrate the centenary of voting rights for women.
                    <br>
                    <br> In April 2018, I decided I was ready to face a new challenge and left my teaching post in order to dedicate
                    more time to developing my front-end skill set.
